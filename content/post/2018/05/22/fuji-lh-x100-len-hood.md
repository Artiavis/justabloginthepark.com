In the continuation of my slow but inexorable backslide into the Fuji camera gear
universe, I recently picked up a secondhand lens hood for my
[X100T]({{<relref "purchased-fuji-x100t.md">}}). Although it was a bit on the
expensive side, I figured the construction would be of higher quality and more
natural looking (in keeping with the traditional charm of the camera itself).

## Construction and fit

The lens hood system comprises two pieces, and adapter which threads onto the
front of the base lens; and the hood itself, which cleverly twists and locks onto
flanges on the edge of the adapter.

The adapter itself adds a bit of space in front of the lens, which means it
becomes safe to use a filter (whereas one otherwise needs a spacer to use a filter).

The adapter and any filters do add some slight margin to the camera body, but the
hood itself changes things entirely; once the hood is installed, the camera is
no longer slim enough to adroitly slip into a pocket book or commuter backpack.
While the extra bulk somewhat reduces the extreme portability of the camera,
the tradeoff is generally worthwhile, especially because the hood screws on and
off easily enough.

## Performance

There's not much to say here; the hood works as advertised, and is particularly
useful in two not-uncommon shooting situations:

1. Any shooting on or near reflective environments (e.g. the open sea), where
   glare and reflections may be an issue. (Sure, a polarizing filter could
   help here as well, but a polarizing filter isn't always handy or desirable.)
1. Light rain

I took this lens hood on a recent vacation, and I got a lot more utility out of
it than I was expecting. Whereas previously, the slightest drizzle would put the
damper on my shooting, the lens hood gave me confidence to keep shooting until I
got the shot I wanted (or the rain started really pouring). And, an unexpected
boon, the hood makes me less inclined to "wrap" my fingers right onto the lens
and leave a nasty smudge.
