## I Got an Instant Pot

Last year, I picked up an [Instant Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Pot) multi cooker, thinking it would simplify cooking dinner on weeknights. Now that I've owned and used it for about 9 months, I'd like to share what I like about it, and what I don’t. For the record, I’m using the basic [Instant Pot Duo 6-quart model](https://amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/).

### Capabilities I Use

The Instant Pot is sort of like a [Dutch Oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_oven) — it’s a thick-bottomed steel pot that can sauté, steam, and pressure cook food. And, much like a Dutch Oven, it’s very handy that quite a few recipes can be made in a single pot, which simplifies preparation and cleanup.

- Sauté mode is overkill for just frying random items,
  but it’s great for browning chicken or vegetables for a stew.
- I don’t use steam mode _that often_,
  but it’s nice for a healthy side dish of steamed broccoli or asparagus.
- Pressure cooking works great for _some recipes_,
  and actually is _better than the alternatives_ for several more.
  - I get great, reproducible results for hard-boiled eggs and for anything rice.
    It’s the best thing I’ve tried for these “simple” but often fiddly recipes.

#### Recipes Which Work Well

I’ve had great results for the following types of recipes:

- Hard-boiled eggs
- Rice recipes taken or adapted from [Amy + Jacky Pressure Cook Recipes](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/):
  - [Perfect Instant Pot Rice](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-rice/#recipe)
  - [Perfect Instant Pot Brown Rice](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-brown-rice/#recipe)
- Soups
- Wet stews

#### Recipes Which Don’t

I’ve had _really bad results_ with thick stews and chilis.
Even recipes which I imagined would be fine
(and always turned out fine in the slow cooker)
fail miserably for me in the Instant Pot:

- Hungarian Goulash
- Chili
- Other Hearty Beef Stews

Whenever I try these recipes, I end up scorching the bottom of the pot,
and the Instant Pot deactivates itself to avoid a steam explosion.

I learned why this happens on
[reddit.com/r/InstantPot](https://reddit.com/r/InstantPot);
unlike a slow cooker or a Dutch Oven which heats from all sides,
an Instant Pot can only heat the bottom of the pot.
Intense bottom-heating tends to work out rather badly with gravity —
the heaviest foodstuffs sink to the bottom of the pot and can scorch.

### Capabilities I Never Use

The model I purchased has 7 marketed capabilities,
but I never use half of them:

- I don’t use the rice cooker mode because
  I prefer the results from the recipes above instead.
- I don’t use the slow cooker mode because I’ve heard
  bad things about it online,
  and I own both a dedicated slow cooker besides.
- I don’t use the yogurt mode because I don’t use my Instant Pot for dairy.

### How Does It Compare to a Dutch Oven?

When time permits, and especially for stews and chilis,
I much prefer the results from a Dutch Oven over those
from the Instant Pot. The Instant Pot can’t braise —
it can’t caramelize the tops of meat and vegetables to
get that beautiful brown char. For example, I would never
want to do a brisket in the Instant Pot.

For simple soups or other one-pot recipes, I find the results
broadly comparable. I would pick the Instant Pot for time and
convenience, and the Dutch Oven for flavor.

### Does It Make Weeknights Easier?

The original point of buying an Instant Pot was to make weeknights
easier. I find it _helps_ on weeknights in two regards:

- The Instant Pot makes it possible to cook a whole soup
  or stew recipe in under one hour. I simply don’t have the time
  required to do traditional soup/stew recipes from scratch on a weeknight otherwise.
- The Instant Pot greatly simplifies rice or steamed vegetable preparation. 

It’s not a miracle product, and I don’t think it quite lives up to the hype,
but _I am generally happy with my purchase_.
