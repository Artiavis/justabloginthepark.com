## About Me

My name is Jeff Rabinowitz. I'm a nerd and programmer living in
West Orange, NJ with my beautiful wife and 2 rambunctious kids.
I currently work in cloud infrastructure software.
My interests include finance, economics, biology, photography,
programming and programming languages,
DIY'ing, cooking, baking, coffee, sourdough, fountain pens, and gardening.

You can see my social media profiles on the navbar at the top of my site.
