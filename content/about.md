## About Me

My name is Jeff Rabinowitz. I'm a nerd and programmer living in the outskirts of 
New York City with my beautiful wife. I currently work in advertising technology (primarily using Java).
My interests include finance, economics, biology, photography,
and especially programming (and programming languages).

You can see my social media profiles on the navbar at the top of my site.
